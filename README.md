# Not Finished Project
I started the coding this project in 2010.So I didn't look this project until now.The project isn't finished and I will not finish this project.I am putting here this project because thats a good example for Gtk+ and Webkit2 library.The project is so old.But I think it's still working.

# Bugs
When gezgin run history.py there is a problem.History founction must be in gezgin.py
gezgin can't download files.I didn't know how WebKit2 download a file.
user.db is unprotected.That's why you must encrypt it.
